# Sample: Sunday Sermon Excerpt (Ghostwritten for Megachurch Pastor)

> “When Grace Runs Out of Patience”

Beloved, the prodigal son did not return because the father chased him.
He returned because the pigs began to look better fed than he was.

Grace is not endless tolerance.
Grace is the voice that says: “Come home before the mud becomes your mirror.”
